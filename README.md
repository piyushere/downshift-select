# Downshift-select

### The objective of this project is to create an exact clone of the react-select using downshift.js.

## But why?

- Downshift.js API is really easy to extend and manage.
- We can use TailwindCSS, instead of react-select's opinionated emotion.js.
- Async functionality of react-select doesn't come with debounce/throttle,
  even if you were to write it by yourself, fine grained control is hard to achieve.

Atm, it's not a library, just a POC.
